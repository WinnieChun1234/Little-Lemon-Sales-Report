# Sales-Report

This is a graded assignment in the course on Coursera. In this course, I chose to setup MySQL in the conda environment and run the code on jupypter notebooks for simplicity. 

### Tasks:
- Establish connections between Python and MySQL databases using the MySQL Connector/Python API
- Create a cursor object to communicate with MySQL
- Create a database
- Create tables and insert data to the tables
- Perform CRUD operations
- Implement a stored procedure to automate tasks
- Establish a connection pool using MySQLConnectionPool, optimizing resource utilisation
- Create analysis report
